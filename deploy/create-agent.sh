# remembered.
#
# **Two accounts, because the wall is two gates and one identity**, per
# `weaver-state-PRD` section 4 as ruled 2026-09-04. The service gate is
# kernel-class: the member dials the store's socket under its own account and
# the peer is verified by credential. The object gate is the database and the
# role's grants. Peer authentication welds them, the store mapping the
# member's kernel identity to its role, so the agent's own uid maps to no
# role and is refused at the second gate where it was not refused at the
# first. That refusal is verified at the end rather than assumed.
#
# **No password exists anywhere in here.** Peer authentication derives the
# object gate's identity from the kernel fact rather than asserting it a
# second time, so there is no secret to store, rotate, or leak.
#
# **The member's account is derived and no longer named**, as of 2026-09-15 and
# issue #545. `weaver-admin` resolves `weaver-<name>-state`, drops to it at the
# member's spawn, hands it the territory by chown, and asks the store's first
# gate as it, so there is one account the store must admit and this script
# cannot choose a weaker one. The `--member-identity` flag that named the
# choice while the code ran the member as root is refused rather than ignored,
# a box provisioned under it having mapped root in `pg_ident.conf`.
