# **The features the build takes decide what an agent can elect.**

# name an engine installs a member that refuses every agent electing it.
# Measured 2026-09-11: karl's load refused with `descriptors_unusable` while
# the territory's state.log held the real fault, `no engine named "postgres"
# in this binary`, and the installed member carried none of the postgres
# symbols the pinned experiment stacks do.
#
# **Every engine the stack serves is named, the default one included.**
# `weaver-state` is `default = ["sqlite"]`, so an earlier form of this line
# shipped sqlite by inheritance while claiming to enumerate what is in.
# Narrowing that default, or passing `--no-default-features` for any reason,
# would then have refused every sqlite-electing agent: this act's own fault in
# the other engine, with this line printing a set that said nothing about it.
# Substrates arrive one at a time and each is named rather than inherited.
#
# **Two sets, because the test step selects fewer packages than the build.**
# A feature of a package the step does not select refuses with `none of the
# selected packages contains this feature`, so the members' set is stated once
# and the spu's is added for the build alone.
# **What the deployment installs is named, not discovered.** A form of the
# plan below walked the build directory to find its subject, and this box sets
# `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to a directory another project shares: the plan proposed
# installing fifty-odd files, every `.d` and `.rlib` among them, and `hades`
# and its libraries from a workspace that has nothing to do with this one.
# Discovering the subject from a directory is how a deployment installs what
# it was never asked to. The build also makes `weaver-analysis` and
# `weaver-spu-classify`, which this script does not ship. The build below is
# the whole workspace, the frontend having left the repository on 2026-09-26.

# **Admin's answer on stdout and its cause on stderr, both kept.** Admin
# prints its answer as the last line on stdout and writes why it refused to
# stderr before it, as `boundary unverified: <cause>` or `config invalid:
# <cause>`. The answer is what a caller compares. The cause is what the
# operator reads beside a rollback, and a `tail -1` over the merged stream
# kept the one and dropped the other, so a refusal named no reason (#673,
# measured on the W4a run of 2026-09-25). Every line before the answer is
# relayed to stderr, marked as admin's.
# **A refusal is this function's answer, not its failure.** `weaver-admin`
# exits non-zero when it refuses, and under `set -e` a bare substitution
# would kill the script at the first agent that needed reconciling, which is
# every agent step 8 exists for. Measured on this box 2026-09-04: the run
# printed the step's header, installed binaries already in place, and
# stopped without reconciling, verifying, or rolling back.

# an error, the comparison below is unchanged for an agent that has run and
# is stronger for one that has not, because every line it then holds is new.

# make the sink at all measures no growth and is caught rather than excused.

# absent one.** The trace sink elects one of three kinds and the other two
# name a fifo and a socket, neither of which a line count reads: counted as
# empty they would refuse a load that in fact wrote, and read with `wc` a
# fifo would block until something closed it. This answers the caller rather
# than exiting, because both calls sit inside a command substitution where an
# exit would leave only the subshell and the install standing.

# the others' declarations changed and never loaded.
