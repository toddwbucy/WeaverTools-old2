//! Admit and release, per `weaver-spu-Spec` section 3.
//!
//! Admit runs the charter's five steps and the first three are free: resolve
//! the binding to an artifact, read what the artifact declares about itself
//! without loading it, judge the assigned devices, take them in shard order and
//! load each shard, confirm. Every step before the fourth is refusable at no
//! cost, which converts the common shape of a bad binding, an artifact present
//! and wrong, into a refusal costing no device work.
//!
//! **The devices are the binding's and this crate selects none.** No device
//! survey, no ranking, no fallback: the archived tree's `auto_select_gpu` does
//! not cross.
//!
//! **Nothing is idempotent and nothing retries.** This crate begins empty,
//! admits once, and dies, so a second admit has no prior residency to match.
//!
//! **No path-taking model loader exists beyond the binding's own resolution.**
//! The one door to a load is [`Admission`], which only `admit` constructs, so
//! the loader cannot be handed a path that did not walk the free steps: the
//! resolution, the header read, and the judgments run first or the load is not
//! expressible. The two shapes the Spec names are pinned below, and the day
//! either compiles, the pin fires.
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn pin(path: &str) -> weaver_spu::residency::Admission<'_> {
//!     // A loader door from a bare string does not exist.
//!     weaver_spu::residency::Admission::from(path)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! fn pin(path: std::path::PathBuf) -> weaver_spu::residency::Admission<'static> {
//!     // Nor from a PathBuf outside the admission path.
//!     weaver_spu::residency::Admission::from(path)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A compile-fail pin passes on any compile error, so the two above would go
//! on passing if [`Admission`] were renamed or its accessors removed, proving
//! nothing. This one compiles, names the door and its surface, and fails
//! loudly the day either disappears:
//!
//! ```
//! fn reads<'a>(admission: &'a weaver_spu::residency::Admission<'a>) -> &'a std::path::Path {
//!     admission.path()
//! }
