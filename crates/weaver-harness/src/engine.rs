//! Loop 1's seat and the decode surface it composes, per `weaver-harness-Spec`
//! sections 6 and 6.1. The loop itself is the builder's, written at the worker
//! composition root and compiled into the worker binary. What this crate holds
//! is the seat and the granted surface the loop composes against.
//!
//! **The extension seam is crossed at loaded-and-idle itself**: loop 0 hands a
//! standing interior to whatever loop 1 the binary carries, and takes it back
//! at the stop and at the leave, the bracket discipline being loop 0's for
//! every loop alike. The interior is handed as a borrow, so a loop holds the
//! surface for exactly as long as loop 0 lends it and cannot outlive the run.
//!
//! **The blade is structural.** A port is a type this crate owns with a
//! constructor no consumer can reach, so a loop composes against the granted
//! surface or does not compile. There is no call by which a loop mints a port:
//! [`Ports`] has private fields and a crate-private constructor, and a loop
//! that needs a port this surface does not offer is a capability change
//! entering through the front door as a charter and contract edit.
//!
//! **The turn is loop 0's machinery, granted.** Loop 1 supplies the delta and
//! receives the outcome, and loop 0 drives the append-and-generate exchange,
//! consumes the stream, reads the close, and authors the record. Loop 1
//! authors nothing, which is the sole-writer property held where the turn runs.
