# weaver-harness / weaver-state - contract

**Status:** MERGED. In `main` and the source of truth.

**Document ID:** `weaver-harness-state-contract`
**Editorial:** Per the Working Rules.
**Landing PR:** #740

## Parties

- **`weaver-harness`, the feeder and the asker.** Applies the tee of
  `weaver-trace-PRD` section 11 and sends what it elects across this seam. The
  only party that will ever ask, its own loops asking through it. Decides
  everything: what is elected, what any held fact is worth, and what to do
  with an answer.
- **`weaver-state`, the custodian.** Receives the distillate, holds it
  organized, and will answer asks when the ask exists. Transforms as part of
  organizing, per its charter, and decides nothing.

No third party reaches this seam. The model has no path to it, per
`weaver-state-PRD` section 2, and no other crate holds an end.

**This seam is a wire.** State crosses a process line, per apex section 9's
re-entry door, so this contract governs a protocol on a transport: a connected
Unix socketpair, stood at load, authenticated by descriptor possession per the
first invariant's rule for a channel with no name, per the operator's ruling of
2026-08-26. Admin creates the pair at the member's spawn and speaks on neither
end: the member inherits its end with its process, the harness receives the
other inside the enter directive beside the trace sink that already crosses
there, and no name exists for any third party to find, replace, or dial. A
standing of the channel is a load's pair, and a reopened channel is the next
load's new pair.

## Vocabulary

Every contract names the vocabulary it depends on, grouped by the crate that
defines it. A contract without this clause is not a valid contract, and a group
is stated even when empty.

**From `weaver-trace`.** The `canonical-event`, defined at `weaver-trace-PRD`
section 2.3, and its envelope fields: `session`, `run`, `turn`, `kind`, and
`sequence`, spelled as that crate's canonical form spells them. The distillate
is a projection of the canonical form and never a reshaping of it, so every
name that crosses this seam is a name the record already carries. The harness
draws it.

**From `weaver-types`.** Nothing. The distillate's shape is this seam's own
vocabulary, defined below, and the floor carries no member for it, per the
custody rule of apex section 5.2: the floor carries only what the harness
itself consumes, and what crosses here is consumed by state.

**From `weaver-traits`.** The message model. A pair elected from a message kind's
`role` or `content`, and every pair of a message kind that crosses whole, carries that
member of a conversation message in the shape that crate defines, and this contract
does not redefine it. The harness renders the message from it and state reads the
pair through it, so the name crosses in both directions. It is floor on the
harness's own consumption, the harness being the party that reads a message as a
message, so state drawing it adds no member to the floor, per apex section 5.2.

**From `weaver-spu`.** Three members of the generation measurement, `perplexity`,
`entropies` and `surprisals`, in the spelling and with the absence `weaver-spu-Spec`
section 6 gives them, which is authoritative where this clause and that section
disagree. A pair elected from `model.measurement` at one of the three carries that
reading as the SPU rendered it, and an unproduced reading crosses as no pair at all.
The measurement's other members are the SPU's too and are named here once that
section spells them, until when they cross as values this contract does not name.
State reads the three member by member and the floor carries no measurement shape,
the harness consuming none of it.

**This seam's own.** Four terms. The `election`: the seam's opener, the session the load
declared and, beside it, three facts the load declared about what crosses. Whether every
kind crosses carrying its envelope or only the kinds named do, which kinds are named,
and the payload key paths elected for each. It is sent whole at every standing of the
channel and never per event. **The same three facts are written into the record**, on
the `load` event's payload per `weaver-trace-Spec` section 3, so a reader of a finished
record knows the rule this seam carried without being told it. **The first of the three
is a term of this seam and not a shorthand for the other two**: a deployment electing
every kind and no paths is saying something a list of kinds cannot say, and the record
that flattened it into a list would be recording a different rule. The record carries
the rule and not the session, which rides the opener by the clause below and reaches a
reader from the envelope of every event. That matters to nobody standing this seam and
to everyone replaying it: a replay preloads under the rule the record names or it
preloads a different session under a rule of its own. **The session rides the opener
rather than the ask**, per the operator's ruling of 2026-08-20 on the custody defect: it
is a load-declared fact standing for the channel's life, the same shape as the election
it sits beside, and a restarted member relearns it with its reopened channel exactly as
it relearns the election. An asker naming its own session on every question would put
the fact on the wire per ask and would make the asking loop state something it has no
reason to know. What the member does with it is its own, per section 2: the holdings
answer within the declared session and not across it, which is `weaver-state-PRD`
section 4's boundary made reachable rather than assumed. The `distillate`: one distilled
event, carrying the envelope whole and the elected payload pairs beside it, each pair a
payload key path and the value the canonical JSON held at it. The `ask`: one question
the harness puts to the holdings on the standing channel, carrying a name from the
closed vocabulary section 2 enumerates. The `answer`: the custodian's one reply to one
well-formed ask, sent only when asked and at no other time.

## 1. What this contract governs

The one seam between the harness and its state member: the channel's standing,
the ingest traffic that flows today, the serve direction that is chartered and
unshaped, what each party owes, how the seam fails, and what neither party may
do. It is read alongside `weaver-state-PRD` and neither is complete without
the other.

## 2. The traffic

**Ingest, flowing, one direction, and the election opens it.** The first
traffic on every standing of the channel is the election itself, whole: the
elected kinds and their payload key paths, as the load declared them. The
custodian needs the election before the first distillate, because its
indexes are built from it at load, and a restarted member receives the
identical election with its reopened channel, which is what keeps the
selection deterministic across the processes of one load. After the opener,
the harness sends a `distillate` per elected event, in sequence order, and
is owed nothing back: the fact has one home, state's holdings, and a
confirmation whose one reader would discard it is the retired receipt's
error again. The harness does not wait, and a distillate is not a turn's
work: nothing about a turn's completion depends on this seam accepting
anything.

**Serve, flowing, the second direction, asked and answered on the one
channel.** The cell that stood here closed 2026-08-19: the first asker
arrived as the context-injection loop and the shape below is elected
against its real ask, per `weaver-state-PRD` section 5. After the ingest's
opener, the harness may put an `ask` on the standing channel at any point
in the stream, and the custodian sends exactly one `answer` per well-formed
ask, in the order the asks arrived, and speaks at no other time. **An ask
is answered against exactly the holdings the seam carried before it**,
which is what makes a served fact attributable to a position in the stream:
every distillate sent ahead of the ask is in the answer's view and nothing
sent after it is. The parked replay ask of the paragraph below is this
clause's one exception, its view being the seal's position rather than the
ask's: it parks precisely because the holdings it is for arrive after it,
so every distillate received through the seal is in its answer's view. The
shape and recall asks keep the pre-ask view without exception.

**Every answer is bounded to the session the opener declared**, per the
operator's ruling of 2026-08-20. Holdings a member accumulated under an
earlier session are outside every answer's view, whatever else is true of
them, so an ask cannot reach across the boundary `weaver-state-PRD` section
4 draws. This is a property of the answers rather than of the store: what
becomes of an earlier session's rows on disk is deliberately not settled
here, per the same ruling, and stands as its own question.

**The ask vocabulary is closed and enumerated here, and it holds five names: `shape`,
`recall`, `replay`, `grants`, and `identity`.** The shape ask carries no members, one
member instance holding one session, and asks for the session's shape - what happened,
in what order, in which run, which is the phrase the charter uses for what the default
election holds. Its answer carries the session's runs in the order custody first saw
them, each with its run reference and its held event counts by kind, every name spelled
as the envelope spelled it. The counts are organized envelope fact and carry no
judgment: what a kind's count means to a turn is the asking loop's business, per the
three-way division of `weaver-state-PRD` section 2.

**The `recall` ask returns the conversation as custody holds it**, added
2026-08-19 against the context-management loop's need: after a flush the
decode context is empty and the session's knowledge is not, so the loop
asks for the material and composes its own re-entry. The ask carries one
optional member, `last-turns`: a count bounding the answer to the most
recent turns, absent meaning the session whole. The answer carries the
events of the four message kinds and of `message.restored` in landing order,
each with its envelope whole and its elected pairs beside it - the distillate's
own shape served back - so what returns is exactly what the election kept, no
more recallable than it was distillable. Selection bounds and ordering are
custody's organizing licence, and every judgment about what to keep, summarize,
or drop in the rebuilt context is the loop's.

**The `replay` ask returns the session's elected events whole, in landing
order**, added 2026-08-24 against the diagnostic replay loop's need: the
loop walks a preloaded session positionally, and the message kinds the
recall serves are less than a replay reads, the rendered contributions and
the recorded measurements being the point. The ask carries no members and
the answer serves every held event of the declared session as the
distillate's own shape, envelope and pairs, in landing order, no more
replayable than it was distillable.

**On a member standing with the preload door, a replay ask answers only at a seal.** The
preload door of `weaver-analysis-state-contract` seals its stream, and the ask parks
until a seal has landed, whatever the door's transport is doing: not yet dialed, open
mid-stream, or closed without the seal all park it alike. The last is the clause's
point, because a dead driver's channel closes and its prefix then looks exactly like
holdings at rest, and a retry's opener may yet retire that prefix and seal a whole
preload the parked ask should answer against. So the seal is the only fact that answers,
transport openness answers nothing, and an ask on a standing that never seals is
converted by the asker's bound into the missing answer it always was, per section 3's
bounded-wait rule. **Under a restoring load the `identity` and `recall` asks the harness
sends at the enter park the same way**, per `weaver-state-PRD` section 4: the session
stands from holdings the driver has yet to seal, so the enter waits on the seal rather
than seeding from a store that is empty for a moment, and the
identity ask's refusal of the dead-peer conversion is unchanged, a channel closed
unsealed converting to the missed answer that refuses the enter. On a serving load
electing no restore they answer immediately as before. The replay ask was the one ask
whose answer may wait, and these two join it under that binding alone, the waiting is
not the custodian initiating, and one answer still follows one ask. **The parked ask
steps out of the arrival order, and that is this clause's stated exception to section
4's ordering rule**: a shape or recall ask arriving while a replay ask parks is answered
in its own arrival order, against the holdings the stream carried before it, except the
enter's `identity` and `recall` asks under a restoring load, which park on the seal
themselves per the clause below and step out of the order the same way, and the replay's
answer follows the seal whenever that is, its view the seal's position, every distillate
received through the seal in it. What keeps the pairing unambiguous without a
correlation member is that every answer names the ask it answers, per the answer's own
shape, and at most one replay ask parks per channel: **a second replay ask arriving
while one parks replaces it**, the first cleared unanswered, the seal answering the
newest alone. Replacement is the retry's whole mechanism, because the asker's bound is
the asker's own and its expiry crosses this seam as nothing at all: the custodian cannot
clear a parked ask on a fact it cannot see, so what clears one is the next ask or the
channel's close, and an asker whose patience ran out retries by asking again rather than
by any un-ask this seam does not carry. The cleared ask's answer is never owed, its
asker's bound having already converted it to the missing answer. An asker that cannot
tell a late replay answer from a prompt shape answer has not read the answer's name, and
no further identity crosses the seam for it. On a member standing without the preload
door, the ask answers immediately, against the holdings the stream carried before it,
like its two siblings.

**The `grants` ask returns the boundary as the store states it**, added 2026-09-04
against the leave clause of `weaver-trace-PRD` section 3.1: the record names what its
state was built into, and the harness reads the store's grant surface at the enter and
again at the leave so the `unload` event can say whether the boundary moved inside the
session. The ask carries no members. The answer carries one member, `surface`, an
ordered list of strings the engine renders from its own catalog, under the service
engine the role's attributes, its memberships, the database's access list, and the table
grants it holds, and under the embedded engine the file's owner, group, and mode, the
filesystem being the boundary there. The lines are spelled so two readings compare as
equal or not and for nothing else: the harness compares and the record carries the
comparison, and custody states the surface and never judges it, per section 4. The ask
answers immediately against the store, holding no event and parking never, like `shape`.

**The `identity` ask returns the session's seated prefix as custody holds it**, added
2026-09-04 against the ruling of `weaver-state-PRD` section 4 that the identity is the
session's first holding: the harness asks once at every enter, after this seam stands
and before the decode session opens, and what answers is what the open seats. The ask
carries no members. The answer carries one member, `messages`, the turnless
`message.system` events of the declared session's most recent run that holds any, in
landing order, because every load seats the prefix and the prefix door records it again,
so the session holds one prefix per run and the one in force is the newest run's, each
served as the distillate's own shape, envelope and pairs, the pairs being the prefix's
payload whole because that kind crosses the tee whole under every election. An empty
list is an answer and not a miss: it says the store holds no prefix for the session,
which is the first load, and the harness seeds from the declaration. **This is the one
ask the dead-peer clause of section 5 does not convert**: a missed answer refuses the
enter, because a run whose bounding cannot be read is not a run with no bounding. The
ask answers immediately, holding no event and parking never, like `shape`.

A further ask name is a change under section 7 and does not exist until it merges there.

## 3. What the harness owes

- **The election applied faithfully.** Every event matching the election
  crosses, whole per the election, in the order the record assigned. The
  harness neither thins what was elected nor adds what was not.
- **The envelope always.** Every distillate carries all five envelope fields
  as the canonical form spelled them. An unattributable distillate is a
  defect in the sender.
- **Its own judgment kept to itself.** What a fact is worth is the harness's
  loops' business and crosses this seam in neither direction.
- **Asks from the enumerated vocabulary only, and a bounded wait.** The
  harness sends no ask this contract does not name, and it does not wait
  unboundedly for an answer: an answer that has not arrived inside the
  harness's own bound is a missing answer, treated as the dead peer of
  section 5, and the turn proceeds without the fact.

## 4. What state owes

- **Custody whole.** What arrived is held, organized, and attributable by its
  envelope, and nothing that arrived is judged, ranked, or discarded by any
  policy of the custodian's own. Retention within the session is total.
- **Transformation without judgment.** Derived shapes, aggregates, and
  indexes are custody's work and carry no opinion about what a turn should
  do, per the three-way division of `weaver-state-PRD` section 2.
- **Served as it crossed.** Every pair an answer serves is the value that
  crossed, byte for byte, whatever custody holds it as. A member the
  Vocabulary names may be held typed and every other is held as it crossed,
  and neither changes what an answer spells.
- **The answer, only when asked.** Exactly one answer per well-formed ask,
  in arrival order, each answered against the holdings the stream carried
  before its ask, and no other traffic ever. The one stated exception is
  the parked replay ask of section 2, which later asks lawfully pass. A
  custodian that spoke
  unasked would be initiating, which its charter forbids.

## 5. Failure vocabulary

**A dead peer costs the distillate and never the turn.** If state is gone,
the harness observes closure, drops what it would have sent, and serves turns
exactly as it did before the leg existed, per the loss clause of
`weaver-state-PRD` section 3. The holdings meanwhile stand in state's file,
and the next load's channel reopens against them. There is no buffering, no
retry, and no backpressure onto the turn path: the derivative is rebuildable
from the record, so the cheapest honest answer to a broken seam is to stop
distilling until the next load.

**A malformed distillate is the sender's defect.** State refuses it by
closing nothing: the event is dropped, the defect is state's to surface when
the serve direction gives it a voice, and the record remains authoritative
for what was elected. The seam does not fault the worker for a bad row.

**A dead or silent peer costs the answer and never the turn.** The serve direction fails
the way the ingest does: where state is gone, or an answer does not arrive inside the
harness's bound, the harness proceeds as if nothing were held, the loop composes its
turn without the fact, and no retry follows on this standing of the channel. A malformed
ask is dropped by the custodian without an answer, which the harness's bound converts
into the same missing-answer outcome, and a malformed answer is dropped by the harness
to the same effect. In every one of these the record remains whole and the next load's
channel asks again against holdings that never moved. The `identity` ask of section 2 is
the stated exception, ruled 2026-09-04: its miss refuses the enter rather than costing
an answer, the turn it would cost being every turn of the run.

## 6. What neither party may do

- Neither party writes the trace through this seam, in either direction. The
  distillate is a projection of the record and nothing here flows back.
- Neither party exposes this seam to the model. There is no tool, no verb,
  and no path from the loop's interior to either end.
- Neither party persists across the session through this seam. The file's
  life is `weaver-state-PRD` section 3's and no traffic here extends it.

## 7. Change protocol

A change to the distillate's shape, to the election's semantics, to the
ask vocabulary, or to the answer's shape or its ordering guarantees
touches this contract, and every party merges in the same act. The serve
direction's first shape was a change under this protocol and landed
2026-08-19 with the loop act the charter named, which is the
sentence above kept as the rule it demonstrated: a second ask name enters
by the same door.

## 8. Conformance

The ingest direction is testable against the living producer: a real load, a
real election, real events crossing, and the holdings queried for exactly
what the election named, attributable by envelope. The dead-peer clause is
testable by killing the member mid-run and watching the turn path not
notice. Both land with the code act that opens the seam.

The replay ask is testable against the living pair under a diagnostic load:
a preload landed and sealed, the ask answered with every elected event in
landing order, and the same ask observed waiting in all three unsealed
states, before the dial, mid-stream, and after a sealless close, rather
than answering over emptiness or a prefix, which is the perturbation
its assertion in `weaver-state-Spec` section 4 watches. The retry sequence
is its own case: a parked ask outlived by its asker's bound, a second
replay ask replacing it on the same channel, the seal landing, and the
answer arriving once, for the newest ask alone, the replaced one cleared
unanswered.

The serve direction is testable against the living pair: a real load, real
events landed, and the shape ask answered with exactly the runs and counts
the record shows for the session, in first-seen order. The recall ask is
testable the same way: the answer's events are exactly the elected
message-kind rows, in landing order, bounded to the named turn count where
one was given, byte-faithful to what the tee carried in. The answered-against
clause is testable in time: asks interleaved with distillates, each answer
holding every count the stream carried before its ask and nothing sent
after it. The serve half of the dead-peer clause is testable by asking with
the member gone and watching the turn complete without the fact inside the
bound. All three land with the loop act that shapes the surface.
